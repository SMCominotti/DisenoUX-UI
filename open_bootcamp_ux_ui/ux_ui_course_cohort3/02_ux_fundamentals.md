## How this program is structured

This program is divided into six key sections:

- Fundamentals (Module 2-4)

- UX Intensive (Module 5-8)

- Team design (Module 9-11)

- Portfolio I & II (Module 12 & 26)

- Visual Design (Module 13-21)

- Capstone (Module 22-25)

These courses are designed to transform you from a novice in user experience and user interface design (UX/UI) into a professional product designer ready to use your portfolio of work to apply for jobs in your new career.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224461710-840b1f66-9756-430c-b6d3-e0b3d6beaa6d.png)

Each course will feel like a **cycle**. In each course, **you will work through everything you need to know to design a product**; the courses **will cover topics in increasing levels of detail**, and **you will be expected to become progressively more independent as a designer**. 

For example, in the **Fundamentals course**, you will get a simple overview and learn basic vocabulary and key ideas for the rest of the program. Your assignments will be limited in scope because you will be focusing on getting comfortable with the basics. In the **UX intensive course**, you will explore the UX/UI design process in a little more detail, building on the topics introduced in Fundamentals. Your assignments will begin to ask more of you; you will start creating some of the things that you will need to build on the job, but you'll still have plenty of guidance.

And by the **Capstone course**, you will be completely in the driver's seat. You'll determine what project you want to build and how to go about it.

This kind of repetition and increasing difficulty is the gold standard for educational practice. It avoids overloading you with too much information all at once, and it lets you interact with an idea multiple times so that you can effectively incorporate it into your knowledge base and skill set.

## Course structure

Each of the **seven core courses** will be divided into a series of **modules**, and each module will contain several **checkpoints** that you will need to complete. Below is a brief description of each course:

- **Fundamentals**: Exploring foundations of user experience design

- **UX intensive**: Learning about user experience design focused on industry best practices

- **Team design**: Designing products from a real-world perspective

- **Portfolio I**: Assembling your portfolio

- **Visual Design Focus**: Diving deep into a concentration in visual (UI) design

- **Capstone**: Leveraging your design skills to demonstrate comprehensive solutions that represent all of the design phases

- **Portfolio II**: Polishing your portfolio

At the end of each course, there will be an in-depth assessment that you will need to complete. These assessments will heavily emphasize practical knowledge and applied skills through projects. When you're ready to submit your assessment, please make sure that you're using a link shortener before you submit! One such program is bit.ly. Meet up with your mentor (we'll dive into this soon) and discuss your learnings with them.

## More on the Open Bootcamp learning philosophy

### No right answers

As you'll learn during this program, design is about learning all that you can, producing the best thing that you can, seeing how it goes, and then incorporating feedback to improve. There is never a single right answer in design for how to make something. Similarly, most of the time, your graded assignments in this program will not have a right answer. Instead, the Open Bootcamp team will evaluate the quality of your answers; they will use their design experience to make sure that you are at a level not just to succeed, but to excel in the field.

Note: We're evaluating submissions on our own dime and time, you could meet up with your mentor to get faster responses and replies on your answers.

This means that you can expect to have assignments returned to you with requests for revision. For most people, that's an uncomfortable experience because of the education systems that they grew up in. In a lot of traditional education settings, getting something returned to you and being asked to fix it is a bad sign. To get the most out of this program, you will need to break out of this mindset.

**Once you are on the job in any role in the UX/UI field, you will constantly receive feedback from team members, users, and clients—and you'll be expected to take it seriously and often incorporate changes into your work**. Remember, **feedback is a gift**; **it helps you home in on a target and push your work to be even better**. It does not mean that you failed, did a bad job, or don't know what you are doing. Feedback can only help you improve, so you'll receive a lot of it in this program.

###  Connecting you to outside resources

**The UX/UI design field has a rich history and a lot of pioneers and leaders who are commonly known and referenced in the industry**. That means that if a designer only taught you their way of approaching design and never **discussed outside resources**, they'd be doing you a big disservice.

Throughout the program, you will get a **grounding in the history of design**, and you'll **learn about the key players who shaped modern processes**. The checkpoints will point you to a variety of **outside resources** that you can use to **enrich your knowledge**, either within the checkpoint or at the end in an additional resources section. **Unless it's directly specified for an assignment, you are not required to click through to those additional resources—but it is recommended**. The goal is to help you get familiar with a plethora of resources that you can use within this program and beyond. It's useful to hear from a variety of perspectives outside of just what's written in the program.

### Finding your own resources

This program is enough to get you into your career—but once your career starts, you will still continue to learn as you work on your skills and as the industry changes. You'll see that the design community is constantly trying new things and adopting new ideas. Advances in technology also mean that there are always new tools to learn and new capabilities to design for. To help you prepare for this, you will need to develop skills to find resources on your own and to learn additional things independently.

In this program, you'll sometimes be asked to use the internet to find information that will help you complete a task. This is an intentional exercise to help you develop your research skills. The truth is that the best way to become an expert tech professional is to become an expert at searching for information and discerning the value of the information you find. Ask any designer, developer, or other person in the industry and they will tell you that they constantly look up what they need to know online. Being able to evaluate that information for accuracy will be part of your job.

## Organizing and sharing your work in Notion

As you probably already learned, you will be using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) as your private and collaborative workspace for this program. Notion is a free online workspace for organizing all your notes, work and projects. If you haven't already, [sign up here](https://www.notion.so/signup) for a free personal account.

### Design journal

A large part of building your practice as a designer is about how you approach problems and how you think. To help clarify your thought process for yourself and to share your thought process, many assignments will ask you to do some writing or to create design artifacts that you submit within each checkpoint. It's important to save your design writing and artifacts in your Notion design journal so that you can add them to your portfolio later on and share them with graders.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224462185-a92b2a0c-c494-48c2-9422-7863b79d90dc.png)


You can use [this Notion design journal template](https://uxuiopen.notion.site/uxuiopen/Design-Journal-9f7354465e1742c9b79eaaf8b6440fb3). Open this link in your browser, choose `Duplicate` in the upper right corner, and save the duplicate to your Personal workspace. Feel free to update the logo with your own image and add your name ahead of the word `Design Journal - John Doe` so that we know who's journal we're looking at when you do share it.

You can use your design journal workspace to take notes, link to work that you have done, compile external resources that you've found helpful, and keep any other records that you would like to reference later. For example, each checkpoint has keywords listed at the top. You can copy them into your design journal and fill in the definitions as you read the checkpoint. If you keep your thoughts in your design journal, you can also use them to create blog posts that you publish. Blogging is a common activity in the tech community; it's a great way to connect to other professionals and show potential employers your style.

When you want to include your work from Figma, add a link to the work in the design journal. Do not embed the Figma work into your design journal.
You will create your Notion workspaces as part of this checkpoint's assignment.

### Allow access

Make sure that you update your permissions to provide access to members of the Open Bootcamp team. This is how they can grade your human-graded assignments and evaluate your work at the end of each course. Below are the steps to change your permissions:

1. Click `share` in the top right hand corner.

2. Choose between three options for access:

- Can Read

- Can Comment

- Disabled

To share your assignments, set the status to Can Comment so the team can comment and communicate with you internally. Finally, copy the page link to share.

## Link to a Notion page

You can create quick links between pages in your Notion workspace. For example, add a link to your design system in today's design journal.

#### In-line link in a paragraph

You can create an in-line link to another page in your workspace by @-mentioning it. The in-line page link will look like this: [Help & Support](https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004)

- Type @, then start typing the name of the page you want to link. Select the page you'd like to link in the dropdown that appears.

- @-mentions also allow you to mention a date, notify another person in your workspace, or create a reminder.

### Link as a full-width block

You can create a link to another page in your workspace as its own block that you can click and drag around the page.

Click the `+` button that appears to the left of any paragraph, and select `Link to page` from the dropdown, or use the slash command `/link`.

- If the page you want to link doesn't appear in the dropdown, just start typing where it says `Search for a page...` then select the page you want to link.

- To rearrange, grab the `⋮⋮` handle that appears to the left, then drag around your page. The blue lines will guide you!

#### Link to content blocks

Every content block in Notion has its own anchor link that can be copied and shared. These are for directing someone's attention to a specific section of a long Notion page!

- To link to a block, hover over it and click the `⋮⋮` icon that appears to the left. Choose Copy Link. This will copy the URL of that specific block to your clipboard.

- You can paste this URL anywhere, or use it to hyperlink text in a Notion page, Slack message, email, etc. When you visit the URL or click on a link to the URL, you'll be taken to that specific section of the page.

## Bonus design exercises and homework

At the end of most checkpoints, you will be asked to **complete an assignment**. **Your assignments will help you memorize and assimilate the information and skills that you are learning**. They are designed to transform you from a novice in user experience and user interface design into a professional ready to use your portfolio of work to apply for jobs in your new career.

**With that in mind, there are often optional bonus design exercises and homework at the end of a checkpoint**. These extra tasks and exercises give you an opportunity to **improve your skills and produce extra design artifacts for your portfolio**. **They are not required, and you will not be graded on them**. The program is not intended to overload you with too much information all at once. But repetition and practice are essential for improving your design skills over time. Some of you will be ready to increase your interaction with an idea so that you can better incorporate it into your knowledge base and skill set.

## :star: 2.2 - Your Career

---

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify the essential user experience design components. You will also be able to compare and contrast different career tracks available within the industry
---

User experience (UX) is a term that is becoming increasingly common as more industries start to recognize the value and impact that good UX design can provide. With so many options available to end users, companies can no longer afford to ignore the user experience of their products. A frustrating or confusing user experience will lead to the loss of customers and will directly affect earnings.

But what is user experience design? How does it differ from user experience research or interaction design? It can be confusing to sort through all of the information available on UX, particularly since it is a constantly evolving term that is applied broadly in various contexts.

In this module, you will learn how to sort through the noise. You'll define what user experience is and what a UX designer does, and you'll begin to explore the paths that you can take in your own career.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete a homework:

Search for job listings and identify the skill sets required for each role.
Reflect on your career values and determine which roles appeal to you.
Complete a career roadmap exercise.
During this homework, you'll see some key UX vocabulary terms in use and relate them back to your interests and career path.

## Getting started with UX design

In his classic book **The Elements of User Experience**, author **Jesse James Garrett** conceptualizes the **five planes of UX as parts of an iceberg*+. He explores their varying levels of complexity and how they build on each other.

The bottom of the iceberg is **research and strategy**. A UX designer begins by gathering all of the information that they can about the user for whom they are designing a product. Their goal is to understand the problem thoroughly before starting to design a solution. The next plane of the iceberg is **scope**. In this plane, a UX designer's goal is to translate user needs and business objectives into specific requirements for the content and functionality that the product will offer to users. **Structure** refers to the site map, which is an organized hierarchy and flow of pages on a site. Next is **skeleton**, which is composed of wireframes. These are the concept sketches that are presented before the designer invests too much detail or effort. And finally, **surface**, or visual design, is the interface that the user will interact with.

## Defining UX design

**User experience** can be defined as **the overall experience of a person using a product or service, such as a website or a computer app**. User experience is especially concerned with how easy the product or service is to use.

A user experience designer has a challenging and complex role; they act as a valuable liaison between different departments and team members. User experience is often used as a general term that refers to multiple disciplines, so job descriptions may vary widely based on the skill set and focus that an employer is searching for.

It's important to learn the skills and components of UX. Below is an overview of many of the key areas that you will be exploring in this program. Don't get too bogged down with trying to memorize and deeply understand them at this point. For now, you'll focus on beginning to build your awareness of these areas. You will develop and apply them in future checkpoints.


### Key components and core skills of UX

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224463807-59acf2fc-e245-4cc1-8739-31f47adf8ac2.png)


As you review these skills, begin to take notes for yourself about what excites you. The joy of the UX/UI field is the wide variety of options that you will have. Explore the domains that light you up. Think about what propensities you have now and what new skills you might want to acquire.
Research and analysis: Before ever designing a screen or interface, it's important to understand the problem being solved and figure out who the users are. Gathering requirements is a part of the beginning of every project.

Information architecture: Information architecture encompasses structural design, organization, and labeling of websites, intranets, mobile applications, and social media software. Information architecture aims to organize content so that it is easy to find and use.

Content strategy: Content strategy refers to satisfying business requirements through content creation and distribution. This includes the words on the page as well as the images and multimedia.

- **Wireframing**: A wireframe is a simple illustration of a page's interface. It focuses on the layout, content, function, and behavior. Wireframes should be quick to make and quick to revise, so they do not typically include any styling, color, or graphics.

- **Prototyping**: A prototype is a preliminary version or draft of a product that allows a user to click through the product. It simulates how the software will work before money and time is invested in developing the actual product. A prototype can be either low fidelity with linked-together wireframes, or high fidelity with pixel-perfect mockups.

- **Usability testing**: Usability testing entails evaluating a product or service by testing it with different users. Participants will try to complete tasks while the UX designer observes, takes notes, and sometimes asks questions. Testing the product with a prototype allows usability issues to be identified and fixed before the product is built.

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility is about designing for everyone. Evaluating accessibility will involve analyzing how well products, devices, services, or environments have been designed for people who experience disabilities. A good UX designer makes sure that their designs are usable by as many people as possible.

- **Visual design**: Visual design includes the aesthetics of a site and strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand.

### Soft skills


In addition to core technical and analytical skills, there are also some soft skills that UXers use regularly:

- **Communication**: Communication is vital in any UX/UI role. Designers are responsible for explaining and defending design decisions to their own team as well as to other departments.

- **Flexibility**: Flexibility is vital; you will encounter differing points of view, and feedback and revisions are part of the process. Don't get too attached to your first design, because there may be a better solution or a technical limitation that makes an idea difficult.

- **Empathy**: Empathy is an important skill for any UXer. You'll need to understand what a user's goals are and explore how to help them accomplish their goals.

- **Curiosity**: Curiosity is crucial because learning will be an ongoing process and it's helpful to keep an open mind. UX designers are constantly learning and adapting to new standards and information.

##  The UX designer at work

What does a UX designer actually do? There's still a lot of confusion surrounding the field of UX, and you may need to address this confusion when you're starting a new job as a UX designer. In fact, your first task may be to clearly explain the value that you bring to the company and how you'll realize that value. Advocacy for your job will be at the core of your work as a UX designer. You'll need to highlight the important value you bring by incorporating the user and their needs into every project.

A user experience designer is often a generalist; they may have some or all of these skills listed above. Usually, a UX designer works on a team. And depending on the size and type of the company, the team may be large or small. At some small start-up companies, there is only one lead UX designer for the entire company. And if a company is lean, it means that they want to streamline and focus on delivery and rapid iteration, instead of allocating resources to in-depth research and multiple specialized team members. In cases like this, generalists, such as versatile UX designers, can be very valuable.

The titles below capture many of the current UX roles that exist across industries. However, over the years, the terms and positions have changed and evolved, and they will invariably continue to change and evolve. It's important to keep these shifts in mind as you carve out your own path as a UX designer.

### User experience researcher

A user experience researcher is someone who empathizes with the user and tries to understand their needs, behaviors, and motivations. A UX researcher is a multiteam player. They usually work alongside an array of other people, from business analysts to marketing teams, as they strive to align organizational goals and user needs. UX researchers often work on diverse teams that include UI and UX designers as well.

- Key skills to know: User interviews, survey design, data analysis, usability testing

### Information architect
Information architects are the blueprint makers and information organizers of a product design team. They work to organize information and determine how it should be arranged and displayed, with ease of access and user flow as their guiding principles. Information architecture is a unique field that comes from information and library sciences. This job, which helps to define product strategy, is becoming more and more in demand.

- Key skills to know: Card sorting, understanding of cognitive psychology, library sciences, user research analysis

### Interaction designer
Interaction designers focus on how a user interacts with a product and how they experience using it. This role focuses on designing the details of an interface, including movement, animation, user flows, and visual aesthetics.

- Key skills to know: Visual design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, animation

### User interface designer
User interface (UI) design establishes the look, feel, and experience of a product. From layout and placement to the visual nitty-gritty such as buttons, colors, and fonts, UI designers occupy a unique niche under the user experience canopy. Many organizations combine UX and UI design into a single role.

- Key skills to know: Visual design, user interface patterns, typography, layout best practices, color theory

### Product designer
Product designer is an ambiguous role that varies from workplace to workplace. It tends to include all aspects of product design, from user experience to interface design. Product designers and UX designers often hold the same responsibilities and need the same skill sets.

- Key skills to know: Content strategy, sketching, prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping, storyboarding, scope definition, user interviews, survey design, data analysis, usability testing

### Frontend designer
Frontend web development brings together programming and layout in order to create a website's visual identity and interactions. A frontend designer programs the interface that UX and UI designers ideated, sketched, and prototyped. Frontend designers often work on diverse teams with UX and UI designers, and they are integral to realizing the UX/UI work.

- Key skills to know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks

### UX engineer

The UX engineer is an emerging, multiskilled role that bridges UX design with frontend development. It is similar to the frontend designer, with a slightly different emphasis. Although most UX designers won't do any major development work, the UX engineer is likely a frontend developer, first and foremost, who has developed their UX skills. (In fact, sometimes the terms "frontend developer" and "UX engineer" are interchangeable.) They usually prototype in HTML and CSS, and they're able to easily communicate and transcribe UX work to development teams and vice versa.

- Key skills to know: Strong frontend development expertise, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### UX designer

UX designers often perform some or all of the above roles, depending on the size of the company and team structure. It is a multifaceted job title that presents unique challenges. UX designers act as intermediaries; they advocate between different departments, teams, and stakeholders. They communicate complex concepts in terms that others can understand. A UX designer is responsible for knowing how a website or application functions, as well as how a user interacts with it. They must be able to communicate with end users, listen and respond with empathy, and quickly change strategy based on feedback. They are armed with some basic knowledge of information architecture, frontend code, and the capabilities of backend. And they must bridge the gap between functionality and visual design, while responding with agility to critique and remaining flexible and open minded to different solutions.

## User experience design careers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224464145-3a1ca5f8-0ca8-4c11-aa90-e181a6c7a345.png)

The most desirable product designers have a T-shaped set of skills and experience. In other words, they have an arsenal of skills and depth in one discipline but a breadth of experience across other disciplines. The successful T-shaped designer might be a super-skilled UX researcher who also knows enough frontend and UI that they can work alongside their diverse team of colleagues and help where needed.

They have a principal skill that describes the vertical leg of the T—they're mechanical engineers or industrial designers. But they are so empathetic that they can branch out into other skills, such as anthropology, and do them as well. - Tim Brown

In this program, you will develop a breadth of skills across UX/UI design and develop additional depth in the Visual Design Specialization. It's important to acquire all the general skills and to refine your visual design chops. You want to make yourself marketable and keep yourself open to possibilities that might surprise you, so don't shortchange sections that don't call to you as much at first.

### User experience design landscape

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224464169-33311f81-93cd-4081-8ed5-e06e1d1db6e4.png)

UX design careers consistently rate among the highest for job satisfaction, and the day-to-day work is generally challenging, fulfilling, and well paid.

Based on research from The Creative Group, the current salary data for UX-trained job searchers looks promising: Offcourse the salary varies as per location, these have been primarily remote and non-remote roles across the US

UX designer: 1–3 years: $75,000–$96,250 / 5+ years: $118,000–$148,000

###  Summary
With the growing awareness of the importance of UX, companies of all sizes are seeking talent to improve their products and best practices. Demand for specialized professionals outweighs supply, as there are not enough designers to fill the roles. The average salary for a UX designer is higher than that of a graphic designer and other types of designers with similar experience. The field is growing, and there are no signs of demand slowing any time soon. UX is a rewarding career with high rates of satisfaction among professionals. The role is challenging and requires a willingness to make mistakes and learn from them. The first step is getting started—so well done!

In this checkpoint, you have gained a broad understanding of UX, including a glossary of terms and a breakdown of the components that comprise best practices. You've been introduced to the skills and standardized information that you'll use throughout your career, and you've explored the various roles available within the field. You've explored the differences between each role, including the differences between UI and UX.

You are aware of cross-functional roles and the T-shaped designer analogy. A good UX/UI designer has a solid grasp of both information architecture and the nomenclature for the underlying structures in the app that they are visually designing for. A UX/UI designer must also have some sense of visual design and layout to be able to successfully convey concepts. You do not have to be an artist or even particularly good at drawing. But you do need to be able to at least draw simple concepts that are easy for a team to understand. A UX/UI designer will need to make the occasional on-the-fly whiteboard sketch to explain an idea to their team.

You have been armed with the latest and most accurate salary information, which is published yearly by industry specialists. You know what is possible, and you're aware that many exciting opportunities await creative professionals. A good UX designer constantly stays up to date with information, forecasts, and trends in their chosen field. This is a profession in which you should never rest on your laurels. Design leaders stay ahead of the information curve and constantly apply new knowledge to their craft. Make sure to bookmark and revisit the following list of resources regularly

---

## Additional resources

Because UX develops constantly, and web and usability standards are always evolving, it's very important to stay up to date with information from trustworthy sources. While there are many thought leaders and resources in UX, there are a few who set the standard. Here are some good starting points:

## :star: The design thinking process

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229806766-a0504728-8f35-4af2-b3ea-58159bb29589.png)


### What is design thinking?

In design thinking, a UX designer's goal is to understand the user, reframe their problems, and challenge assumptions. They also try to identify alternative design solutions based on the user and their needs. It's a way of thinking, ideating, and producing that includes hands-on methods.

Design thinking revolves around questioning, understanding, and researching the people the products or services are designed for. You can use this process to help with several key tasks:

- Observing and developing empathy with your target audience.

- Engaging in the process of questioning: questioning the problem, questioning the assumptions, and questioning the implications.

- Reframing design problems in a human-centric way, so that you ideate with an open mind and adopt a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

- Experimenting in fun and experiential ways, such as sketching, prototyping, testing, and trying out concepts and ideas.

### The five steps for the design thinking process are as follows:

1. Empathize: Fully understand, relate to, and share another person's expressions, needs, and motivations.

2. Define: Analyze and synthesize your observations in order to identify the core problems that you've uncovered in a human-centered way.

3. Ideate: Generate ideas, including out-of-the-box and creative, unconventional solutions to the problem identified in earlier stages.

4. Prototype: Develop an inexpensive, scaled-down version of a product to be shared with users. The prototype should be interactive, and it should simulate how the solution will work when it's built.

5. Test: Investigate and observe users interacting with the prototype, and adjust or iterate based on the user's experience and feedback.

---

## Step 1: Empathize

Empathize is perhaps the most crucial and most often overlooked stage in design. In this checkpoint, you'll focus mostly on this stage. Later in this program, you'll explore the other stages in more detail.

### What exactly is empathy?

Empathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror, then share another person's expressions, needs, and motivations. In UX, empathy enables the designer to understand not only the users' immediate frustrations but also their hopes, fears, abilities, limitations, reasoning, and goals.

Empathy is one of the many soft skills that a great UX designer should have. Empathizing with users is key to understanding how to solve their problems—and ultimately, to building better products based around usable solutions. Empathy allows a designer to step outside of their assumptions so that they can see and experience the products that they're designing from the perspective of their users. This creates well-informed and well-researched products that better serve the end users.

Empathy helps designers to understand and interpret people's emotional and physical needs. Empathic research is primarily concerned with facts about people, their motivations, inspirations, and thoughts. It's inherently subjective, but it still holds validity as another tool in a designer's arsenal of methods for creating usable products.

###  Empathy is not pity or sympathy

Empathy requires people to deeply experience what others experience; the same is not necessarily true of sympathy. Sympathy is often associated with a sense of detachment and superiority; when people sympathize, they tend to feel pity and sorrow for another person.

Sympathy is not just useless in the design thinking process—it can actually be detrimental to good design. Good, user-centered designers are concerned with understanding the people they are designing solutions for, rather than judging them or projecting their own emotions onto their experience.

###  Users don't always tell you what they need
As a user-centered designer, you need to develop intuition, imagination, emotional sensitivity, and creativity. With these skills, you can extract the right kinds of insights so as to make more meaningful and usable products. People do not always convey all the details or communicate what they need in a standardized way. You'll need to use empathy in order to really understand people.

### Empathy is crucial to business success

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229807891-8d7e6a05-0b23-4991-942b-ee19d42f69a1.png)

here are three key parameters that define a successful product or service: desirability, feasibility, and viability. Considering these parameters is an important part of empathizing with your users.

To be successful, a product or service must be technically feasible to create and maintain. It must turn a profit or offer other benefits so that it is viable from a business perspective. And users need to desire it; they must deeply relate with the solution that you are offering with your design, and be willing to trust the process.

For example, Google Glass was a failure on the company's part because users didn't like the experience and didn't feel good using the product. By contrast, the iPod was very successful at not only providing a technological solution but also providing a completely desirable and profitable experience for the user. As a result, Apple gained a market lead.

Think about a time that you tried a product, and it either didn't meet your needs or was frustrating to use. Did you continue using the product? Or did you move on to a different solution? This is the scenario that UX designers want to avoid by making sure that they understand what users will actually use.

### Examples of empathize deliverables

You may be musing, "All this thinking is good, but what does a UX/UI designer actually do?" Whatever the task at hand, UX professionals need to produce tangible records of their work. These records can include a wide range of items: data, reports, presentations, sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and more. These items are usually referred to as deliverables. Deliverables are the artifacts or other outcomes that a designer produces from the work that they do. Artifacts—the concrete items produced by the designer—can take many forms.

Deliverables help UX designers communicate with various stakeholders and teams, document work, and generate materials for meetings and ideation sessions. They also help create a single source of truth; they can serve as guides and specifications for implementation and reference. Below are some examples of common types of deliverables that might be created during the empathize stage.

1. **Persona**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229808179-21289494-8579-4680-b414-191864048903.png)

A persona is a fictional user's profile, which is used to communicate and summarize user research. Each persona has defined goals and characteristics, which are representative of the needs of a larger group of users. Designers use personas to represent many users at once because designing with an individual composite "person" is easier than trying to design for thousands of different people.

2. **Empathy map**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229808341-1ee75b09-8927-4a73-a4f7-65c6ea0ccec1.png)

An empathy map is a graphical tool used to help you imagine things from a user's perspective. It usually asks you to answer some questions from a user's perspective as they encounter a task, such as the following: What do they see and hear? What do they think and feel? What do they say and do? By writing down these imaginings, you can more clearly conceptualize your persona interacting with a problem.

3. **Quantitative survey**

A quantitative survey contains objective questions used to gain detailed insights from respondents about a survey research topic. Results from these surveys are used to gather numerical data and determine statistical results, and the data can share insights about user behavior. Quantitative surveys are also useful for justifying decisions to stakeholders.

---

## Step 2: Define

During the define stage, you connect the dots from the empathize stage. You analyze your observations and describe them so that you can define the core problems that you and your team have identified up to this point.

### Examples of define deliverables

#### Problem statement

In this stage, you should seek to define the problem in a formal problem statement. The final problem statement is a simple but effective way to bring focus to the insights that you've uncovered with your empathy maps. Ultimately, when you're making decisions, you must always return to the question, "Does this solution solve the problem statement?" If the answer is no, you have gotten off course. Ask this question frequently—you don't want to produce a fully developed product and then discover that it didn't actually solve the problem!

In every project that you complete in this program, you will be asked to explain how your solution addresses your problem statement.

#### Competitive analysis report

A competitive analysis report outlines the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors compared to those of your own business. Typically, it contains a description of your business's target market and details about the features of your product compared to your competitor's products. It is beneficial to know what your competitors are offering, what needs you can fill, and what problems you can find solutions for.

However, it's important to note that other types of professionals, like digital marketers, also develop competitive analysis reports to better understand the competitive landscape. A UX designer, by contrast, would likely go further and deeper into the design flaws of a competitor's product. For instance, they may engage in a heuristic analysis, which is a technique used to evaluate the interface and design of a product against specific design standards and principles. (But don't worry—you'll learn more about heuristics later in this program.)

---

## Step 3: Ideate

Ideation is a fancy word for coming up with ideas. By this stage, you've built a solid foundation: you have a clear understanding of who your users are and what they need, what problem you are trying to solve, and what solutions exist out in the world already. Now you can finally start thinking about what you are going to make!

### Some ways to ideate

1. **Brainstorming**: Most people are familiar with brainstorming. To get the most out of brainstorming, set a time limit. Try to focus on quantity over quality and write down as many ideas as you can think of. Do not worry about whether your ideas are practical, too expensive, or unrealistic. Just try to get down as many ideas as you can without judgment. The weirder or more outrageous, the better! This process can be done alone or in a group setting.

2. **Mind mapping**: A mind map is a visual diagram that represents words, tasks, and ideas associated with a central keyword or idea. It doesn't have to be restricted to just words; you can also use drawings or colors. Begin with writing one word that summarizes the problem that you want to solve or the idea that you want to build on. Then, from that word, draw lines out and branch off into new words that relate to the core issue. You can also use other elements, such as color or imagery. Use lines to show connections between ideas and solutions. Create subbranches for ideas related to the main branch's ideas.

### Examples of ideate deliverables

1. **Sketches** : Sketching is a crucial skill in UX design. Be wary of the impulse to skip it! If you can sketch simple shapes—like rectangles, squares, circles, lines, and stick figures—then you can quickly communicate concepts and revise them on the fly. If you can sketch quickly, you can share an idea and immediately influence the outcome of a meeting with stakeholders, instead of taking hours to make wireframes. Also, nothing is more frustrating than spending hours on wireframes and then having to scrap them completely and start over because there wasn't an initial consensus on direction.

2. **User flow**: A user flow is the path that a user typically takes on a website or app to complete a task. The flow leads from the entry point, through a series of steps, and toward a final action such as purchasing a product. User flows are useful to help demonstrate to other team members how a user interacts with an application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229809545-df0027e2-f341-4812-a794-d22dde4315ae.png)

3. **User stories**: A user story (also called a use case) is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website. Each one is a documentation of a sequence of steps, starting with a user's goal and ending when the goal is fulfilled. There can be multiple user stories for one application, depending on what a user is trying to accomplish and whether they're working toward a main or tertiary goal. These user stories should clearly demonstrate how your solution resolves your problem statement.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229809716-951b9204-760c-452e-9783-c46fbe242720.png)

4. **Storyboards**: In UX, a storyboard is a tool that visually lays out and explores a user's experience with a product—similar to the storyboards that are used in movies. Storyboards are valuable because they provide context about how and why people use products. They provide insight into the users' surroundings and goals, and they build relatable narratives.


5. **Mood boards**: Mood boards communicate the artistic direction of a project. They are created through a collection of images, fonts, interactions, features, icons, and UI elements. It can be useful to look at different projects for inspiration about visual design and other features.

---


## Step 4: Prototype

In this stage, the design team produces some inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product. These prototypes are useful for investigating the design solutions generated in the previous stage.

This stage helps the design team get a better idea of the challenges and constraints that are present. It allows internal and external stakeholders to get a better idea of how real users will interact with the end product.

### Examples of prototype deliverables

1. **Wireframes**: Think of a wireframe as a blueprint that provides the basic framework of a website. Some features are included, but they are not very detailed. Wireframes are valuable because they include enough features to conceptualize what the product will look like and how it will function—without spending too much time on visual details like color and typography.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229810148-56d27347-42bd-43af-a8b2-dd75ddb4b788.png)

2. **Prototypes**: A prototype is a clickable series of connected mockups that simulates how the solution will work when it's built. Sometimes it is difficult to explain a concept to team members; a clickable prototype that functions like the real software can help with clarification.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/229810315-54ac7a68-bdc9-4213-a3e7-8582f99a72dd.png)


---

## Step 5: Test

In this stage, designers or evaluators go through the process of real-time testing. Although this can seem like the last stage before a product is sent over to the developers, design thinking is actually an iterative process. The results generated during the testing phase are often used to define pain points in a product's design. Then the team might go back to the prototype stage and work through these issues before retesting the product.

### Examples of test deliverables

1. **Usability report**: A usability report is a document that allows you to gain insight into user expectations and frustrations. It can be crucial in evaluating your product's success. It provides insight into user frustrations and behavior, which can provide feedback and improve the product.

2. **Analytics report**: An analytics report is a custom report with dimensions and metrics that you decide. It's a good way to explore custom information and deeper targeted metrics about your product.

---

### Summary

In this checkpoint, you explored the design thinking process, which consists of the cognitive, strategic, and practical processes that go into developing design concepts.

Throughout this checkpoint, you focused on the key element of empathy. Empathize is the first stage of the design thinking process, but designing with empathy is essential throughout all five steps of the process. Empathy is crucial to a human-centered design process because it helps design thinkers to set aside their own assumptions about the world in order to gain insight into their users and their needs.

As you learned, UX designers do a lot of different things on a daily basis. In this checkpoint, you also evaluated UX deliverables. Whatever the task at hand, UX professionals need to communicate design ideas and research findings to a range of audiences. They use deliverables for that purpose.

## :star:  Assignment 3 ⭐

### Empathy mapping, mind mapping, and brainstorming

This exercise will demonstrate the value of empathy mapping and understanding different users. It will help you to get to know two personas better, and it can help to fill in any knowledge gaps that you may have overlooked initially.

For this activity, you are going to make two empathy maps for two personas. These personas represent different people who are purchasing a car. The goal is to use empathy to find out more about each user, and then apply the findings toward making the experience better for both of them. This activity and mode of thinking can be applied to any type of product or service, including digital interfaces. Whether you're empathy mapping for a vehicle-purchasing journey or for someone using an app, the same methodology applies.

1. Make a copy of the empathy map template.

2. Consider the simple personas below:

- The first user is Maria, a 72-year-old retired woman with an upper-middle-class income. She sometimes cares for her three grandchildren, who are all under the age of eight.

- The second user is Seth, a 23-year-old working-class student who works full time. He attends night classes to work toward his associate's degree in music studies.

3. Spend about ten minutes on each persona. Fill out the sections and imagine the perspective of each user. See if you are able to make some connections that weren't immediately obvious. Don't be afraid to include any idea, no matter how far-fetched it may seem. Sometimes out-of-the-box ideas end up being quite valuable. Include at least 5-10 items in each box. Use the questions below to help you.

- What would their fears be? Their concerns?

- What would they want as part of their experience?

- What would they try to avoid based on their individual sets of circumstances?

- How would each user prefer to research their choices? Online? In person?

- Which persona is more likely to care about the stereo system? About safety and security?

- What other features might each user want in their ideal car?

4. On the recommendations page of your template, answer the following question:

- If you were hired by the car dealership to improve the user experience, how would you improve their process based on empathizing with these two different users?
