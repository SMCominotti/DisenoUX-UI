## How this program is structured

This program is divided into six key sections:

- Fundamentals (Module 2-4)

- UX Intensive (Module 5-8)

- Team design (Module 9-11)

- Portfolio I & II (Module 12 & 26)

- Visual Design (Module 13-21)

- Capstone (Module 22-25)

These courses are designed to transform you from a novice in user experience and user interface design (UX/UI) into a professional product designer ready to use your portfolio of work to apply for jobs in your new career.

Each course will feel like a **cycle**. In each course, **you will work through everything you need to know to design a product**; the courses **will cover topics in increasing levels of detail**, and **you will be expected to become progressively more independent as a designer**. 

For example, in the **Fundamentals course**, you will get a simple overview and learn basic vocabulary and key ideas for the rest of the program. Your assignments will be limited in scope because you will be focusing on getting comfortable with the basics. In the **UX intensive course**, you will explore the UX/UI design process in a little more detail, building on the topics introduced in Fundamentals. Your assignments will begin to ask more of you; you will start creating some of the things that you will need to build on the job, but you'll still have plenty of guidance.

And by the **Capstone course**, you will be completely in the driver's seat. You'll determine what project you want to build and how to go about it.

This kind of repetition and increasing difficulty is the gold standard for educational practice. It avoids overloading you with too much information all at once, and it lets you interact with an idea multiple times so that you can effectively incorporate it into your knowledge base and skill set.

Each of the **seven core courses** will be divided into a series of **modules**, and each module will contain several **checkpoints** that you will need to complete. Below is a brief description of each course:

- **Fundamentals**: Exploring foundations of user experience design

- **UX intensive**: Learning about user experience design focused on industry best practices

- **Team design**: Designing products from a real-world perspective

- **Portfolio I**: Assembling your portfolio

- **Visual Design Focus**: Diving deep into a concentration in visual (UI) design

- **Capstone**: Leveraging your design skills to demonstrate comprehensive solutions that represent all of the design phases

- **Portfolio II**: Polishing your portfolio

At the end of each course, there will be an in-depth assessment that you will need to complete. These assessments will heavily emphasize practical knowledge and applied skills through projects. When you're ready to submit your assessment, please make sure that you're using a link shortener before you submit! One such program is bit.ly. Meet up with your mentor (we'll dive into this soon) and discuss your learnings with them.

## More on the Open Bootcamp learning philosophy

### No right answers

As you'll learn during this program, design is about learning all that you can, producing the best thing that you can, seeing how it goes, and then incorporating feedback to improve. There is never a single right answer in design for how to make something. Similarly, most of the time, your graded assignments in this program will not have a right answer. Instead, the Open Bootcamp team will evaluate the quality of your answers; they will use their design experience to make sure that you are at a level not just to succeed, but to excel in the field.

Note: We're evaluating submissions on our own dime and time, you could meet up with your mentor to get faster responses and replies on your answers.

This means that you can expect to have assignments returned to you with requests for revision. For most people, that's an uncomfortable experience because of the education systems that they grew up in. In a lot of traditional education settings, getting something returned to you and being asked to fix it is a bad sign. To get the most out of this program, you will need to break out of this mindset.

**Once you are on the job in any role in the UX/UI field, you will constantly receive feedback from team members, users, and clients—and you'll be expected to take it seriously and often incorporate changes into your work**. Remember, **feedback is a gift**; **it helps you home in on a target and push your work to be even better**. It does not mean that you failed, did a bad job, or don't know what you are doing. Feedback can only help you improve, so you'll receive a lot of it in this program.

###  Connecting you to outside resources

**The UX/UI design field has a rich history and a lot of pioneers and leaders who are commonly known and referenced in the industry**. That means that if a designer only taught you their way of approaching design and never **discussed outside resources**, they'd be doing you a big disservice.

Throughout the program, you will get a **grounding in the history of design**, and you'll **learn about the key players who shaped modern processes**. The checkpoints will point you to a variety of **outside resources** that you can use to **enrich your knowledge**, either within the checkpoint or at the end in an additional resources section. **Unless it's directly specified for an assignment, you are not required to click through to those additional resources—but it is recommended**. The goal is to help you get familiar with a plethora of resources that you can use within this program and beyond. It's useful to hear from a variety of perspectives outside of just what's written in the program.

### Finding your own resources

This program is enough to get you into your career—but once your career starts, you will still continue to learn as you work on your skills and as the industry changes. You'll see that the design community is constantly trying new things and adopting new ideas. Advances in technology also mean that there are always new tools to learn and new capabilities to design for. To help you prepare for this, you will need to develop skills to find resources on your own and to learn additional things independently.

In this program, you'll sometimes be asked to use the internet to find information that will help you complete a task. This is an intentional exercise to help you develop your research skills. The truth is that the best way to become an expert tech professional is to become an expert at searching for information and discerning the value of the information you find. Ask any designer, developer, or other person in the industry and they will tell you that they constantly look up what they need to know online. Being able to evaluate that information for accuracy will be part of your job.

## Organizing and sharing your work in Notion

As you probably already learned, you will be using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) as your private and collaborative workspace for this program. Notion is a free online workspace for organizing all your notes, work and projects. If you haven't already, [sign up here](https://www.notion.so/signup) for a free personal account.

### Design journal

A large part of building your practice as a designer is about how you approach problems and how you think. To help clarify your thought process for yourself and to share your thought process, many assignments will ask you to do some writing or to create design artifacts that you submit within each checkpoint. It's important to save your design writing and artifacts in your Notion design journal so that you can add them to your portfolio later on and share them with graders.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224462185-a92b2a0c-c494-48c2-9422-7863b79d90dc.png)


You can use [this Notion design journal template](https://uxuiopen.notion.site/uxuiopen/Design-Journal-9f7354465e1742c9b79eaaf8b6440fb3). Open this link in your browser, choose `Duplicate` in the upper right corner, and save the duplicate to your Personal workspace. Feel free to update the logo with your own image and add your name ahead of the word `Design Journal - John Doe` so that we know who's journal we're looking at when you do share it.

You can use your design journal workspace to take notes, link to work that you have done, compile external resources that you've found helpful, and keep any other records that you would like to reference later. For example, each checkpoint has keywords listed at the top. You can copy them into your design journal and fill in the definitions as you read the checkpoint. If you keep your thoughts in your design journal, you can also use them to create blog posts that you publish. Blogging is a common activity in the tech community; it's a great way to connect to other professionals and show potential employers your style.

When you want to include your work from Figma, add a link to the work in the design journal. Do not embed the Figma work into your design journal.
You will create your Notion workspaces as part of this checkpoint's assignment.

### Allow access

Make sure that you update your permissions to provide access to members of the Open Bootcamp team. This is how they can grade your human-graded assignments and evaluate your work at the end of each course. Below are the steps to change your permissions:

1. Click `share` in the top right hand corner.

2. Choose between three options for access:

- Can Read

- Can Comment

- Disabled

To share your assignments, set the status to Can Comment so the team can comment and communicate with you internally. Finally, copy the page link to share.

## Link to a Notion page

You can create quick links between pages in your Notion workspace. For example, add a link to your design system in today's design journal.

#### In-line link in a paragraph

You can create an in-line link to another page in your workspace by @-mentioning it. The in-line page link will look like this: [Help & Support](https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004)

- Type @, then start typing the name of the page you want to link. Select the page you'd like to link in the dropdown that appears.

- @-mentions also allow you to mention a date, notify another person in your workspace, or create a reminder.

### Link as a full-width block

You can create a link to another page in your workspace as its own block that you can click and drag around the page.

Click the `+` button that appears to the left of any paragraph, and select `Link to page` from the dropdown, or use the slash command `/link`.

- If the page you want to link doesn't appear in the dropdown, just start typing where it says `Search for a page...` then select the page you want to link.

- To rearrange, grab the `⋮⋮` handle that appears to the left, then drag around your page. The blue lines will guide you!

#### Link to content blocks

Every content block in Notion has its own anchor link that can be copied and shared. These are for directing someone's attention to a specific section of a long Notion page!

- To link to a block, hover over it and click the `⋮⋮` icon that appears to the left. Choose Copy Link. This will copy the URL of that specific block to your clipboard.

- You can paste this URL anywhere, or use it to hyperlink text in a Notion page, Slack message, email, etc. When you visit the URL or click on a link to the URL, you'll be taken to that specific section of the page.

## Bonus design exercises and homework

At the end of most checkpoints, you will be asked to **complete an assignment**. **Your assignments will help you memorize and assimilate the information and skills that you are learning**. They are designed to transform you from a novice in user experience and user interface design into a professional ready to use your portfolio of work to apply for jobs in your new career.

**With that in mind, there are often optional bonus design exercises and homework at the end of a checkpoint**. These extra tasks and exercises give you an opportunity to **improve your skills and produce extra design artifacts for your portfolio**. **They are not required, and you will not be graded on them**. The program is not intended to overload you with too much information all at once. But repetition and practice are essential for improving your design skills over time. Some of you will be ready to increase your interaction with an idea so that you can better incorporate it into your knowledge base and skill set.

## :star: 2.2 - Your Career

---

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify the essential user experience design components. You will also be able to compare and contrast different career tracks available within the industry
---

User experience (UX) is a term that is becoming increasingly common as more industries start to recognize the value and impact that good UX design can provide. With so many options available to end users, companies can no longer afford to ignore the user experience of their products. A frustrating or confusing user experience will lead to the loss of customers and will directly affect earnings.

But what is user experience design? How does it differ from user experience research or interaction design? It can be confusing to sort through all of the information available on UX, particularly since it is a constantly evolving term that is applied broadly in various contexts.

In this module, you will learn how to sort through the noise. You'll define what user experience is and what a UX designer does, and you'll begin to explore the paths that you can take in your own career.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete a homework:

Search for job listings and identify the skill sets required for each role.
Reflect on your career values and determine which roles appeal to you.
Complete a career roadmap exercise.
During this homework, you'll see some key UX vocabulary terms in use and relate them back to your interests and career path.

## Getting started with UX design

In his classic book **The Elements of User Experience**, author **Jesse James Garrett** conceptualizes the **five planes of UX as parts of an iceberg*+. He explores their varying levels of complexity and how they build on each other.

The bottom of the iceberg is **research and strategy**. A UX designer begins by gathering all of the information that they can about the user for whom they are designing a product. Their goal is to understand the problem thoroughly before starting to design a solution. The next plane of the iceberg is **scope**. In this plane, a UX designer's goal is to translate user needs and business objectives into specific requirements for the content and functionality that the product will offer to users. **Structure** refers to the site map, which is an organized hierarchy and flow of pages on a site. Next is **skeleton**, which is composed of wireframes. These are the concept sketches that are presented before the designer invests too much detail or effort. And finally, **surface**, or visual design, is the interface that the user will interact with.

## Defining UX design

**User experience** can be defined as **the overall experience of a person using a product or service, such as a website or a computer app**. User experience is especially concerned with how easy the product or service is to use.

A user experience designer has a challenging and complex role; they act as a valuable liaison between different departments and team members. User experience is often used as a general term that refers to multiple disciplines, so job descriptions may vary widely based on the skill set and focus that an employer is searching for.

It's important to learn the skills and components of UX. Below is an overview of many of the key areas that you will be exploring in this program. Don't get too bogged down with trying to memorize and deeply understand them at this point. For now, you'll focus on beginning to build your awareness of these areas. You will develop and apply them in future checkpoints.


### Key components and core skills of UX

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72580574/224463807-59acf2fc-e245-4cc1-8739-31f47adf8ac2.png)


As you review these skills, begin to take notes for yourself about what excites you. The joy of the UX/UI field is the wide variety of options that you will have. Explore the domains that light you up. Think about what propensities you have now and what new skills you might want to acquire.
Research and analysis: Before ever designing a screen or interface, it's important to understand the problem being solved and figure out who the users are. Gathering requirements is a part of the beginning of every project.

Information architecture: Information architecture encompasses structural design, organization, and labeling of websites, intranets, mobile applications, and social media software. Information architecture aims to organize content so that it is easy to find and use.

Content strategy: Content strategy refers to satisfying business requirements through content creation and distribution. This includes the words on the page as well as the images and multimedia.

- **Wireframing**: A wireframe is a simple illustration of a page's interface. It focuses on the layout, content, function, and behavior. Wireframes should be quick to make and quick to revise, so they do not typically include any styling, color, or graphics.

- **Prototyping**: A prototype is a preliminary version or draft of a product that allows a user to click through the product. It simulates how the software will work before money and time is invested in developing the actual product. A prototype can be either low fidelity with linked-together wireframes, or high fidelity with pixel-perfect mockups.

- **Usability testing**: Usability testing entails evaluating a product or service by testing it with different users. Participants will try to complete tasks while the UX designer observes, takes notes, and sometimes asks questions. Testing the product with a prototype allows usability issues to be identified and fixed before the product is built.

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility is about designing for everyone. Evaluating accessibility will involve analyzing how well products, devices, services, or environments have been designed for people who experience disabilities. A good UX designer makes sure that their designs are usable by as many people as possible.

- **Visual design**: Visual design includes the aesthetics of a site and strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand.

### Soft skills


In addition to core technical and analytical skills, there are also some soft skills that UXers use regularly:

- **Communication**: Communication is vital in any UX/UI role. Designers are responsible for explaining and defending design decisions to their own team as well as to other departments.

- **Flexibility**: Flexibility is vital; you will encounter differing points of view, and feedback and revisions are part of the process. Don't get too attached to your first design, because there may be a better solution or a technical limitation that makes an idea difficult.

- **Empathy**: Empathy is an important skill for any UXer. You'll need to understand what a user's goals are and explore how to help them accomplish their goals.

- **Curiosity**: Curiosity is crucial because learning will be an ongoing process and it's helpful to keep an open mind. UX designers are constantly learning and adapting to new standards and information.
