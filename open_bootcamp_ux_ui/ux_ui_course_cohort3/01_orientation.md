## :star: 1.3 Slack :star

🎯 LESSON OBJECTIVE: By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to join UX/UI Open's Slack community.

🎯 This section includes an Activity 

## Overview

Even though your program is remote, you're not alone. UX/UI Open uses the messaging application Slack, which serves as a space for you to chat with your peers, collaborate, get help, and grow your professional network.

This checkpoint covers how you can join the **UX/UI Open Slack team** and the guidelines that have been established to keep it a supportive, thriving community.

**Since we've just started in Jan 2023, have patience for more people to join. We'll be having a huge global community soon.**

## Slack setup

To start using **Slack**, first, you need to **create an account**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Find your email invitation to UX/UI Open's Slack team. (When you signed up to this your program, you should have received an email inviting you to the Slack community at UX/UI Open. If you didn't receive that email, email uxui@theopenbootcamp.com for help)

2. Click on the Join Now button in the email.

3. Complete your profile. Fill in your name, handle, and other basic information. At this point, you're also given options to download Slack's desktop and mobile apps. It's recommended that you download both.

4. Join your **program channel** and any **local groups** that interest you.

You will be added to **two cohort-specific channels** before your program begins:

- **Cohort channel**: We start a new cohort every other month to ensure that you're in sync with the syllabus and equally motivated to complete the course. You will also be able to collaborate with your fellow cohort members in this channel. At the time of reading you'll be in uxui-cohort-3

- **Assignment channels**: In this channel, you will be able to submit assignments done during the course.

## Slack features and productivity tips

Slack has a ton of ways to help you use the platform more effectively and increase your productivity. Here are a few key tips:

- **Master notifications**. If you aren't careful, Slack notifications can take over your life; this means that you can easily get overwhelmed or miss the information that you are really interested in. **Slack gives you a lot of power to adjust what you get notifications for and how those notifications look**. Go to `Preferences` to set your `notifications by channel` or to `add keywords that you want to be alerted to`. You can also change what you are notified about in the app, on your phone, and by email. Play around and see what works for you. In the middle of something important? You can also mute your notifications. Read more here to learn how to adjust your profile and preference settings.

- **Threads keep it clean**. Many of UX/UI Open's Slack channels are busy and noisy. It's easy to get lost when people are responding to each other about different topics. **To keep things clean and easy to read, use threads**. If you see a post that you'd like to respond to, or if you want to add something to your own post, hold the pointer over the post and click the Start a thread 💬 icon. This will take you to a thread in your sidebar. Now, all the posts for this conversation will be in one easy-to-find place. Click here to learn how you can use threads to organize discussions.

- **Shortcuts FTW!** Rather than scrolling all over to find what you need, use Slack shortcuts to help you work faster. To see a list of shortcuts, press `Control+/ (Command+/ on a Mac)` when you have the Slack app open.

- **Remind me**. Just saw an interesting message but don't have time to respond immediately? Hold the pointer over the message and click the `More actions icon`. Then click `Remind me about this` and `set a time when you want Slack to send you a reminder`. You can also type `/remind` and tell Slackbot to remind you about anything you like.


- **Tag responsibly**. If you have a message that you want a person or a small group of people to notice right away, you can send them a notification by sending them a direct message (located under the Channels section in the sidebar) or by tagging them using the @name function. However, avoid using @here or @channel because these tags will send notifications to all of the members in that group—which could include thousands of people!

- **Keep in contact**. If you have a quick question or comment, you are welcome to use Slack to send direct messages. For longer policy-related questions, concerns, or emergencies, reach out to your academic success manager or mentor via email.



## Slack community guidelines

Finally, Slack should be a positive resource and experience for the entire UX/UI Open community. To ensure this, UX/UI Open has required everyone to follow the guidelines below.

### Be respectful

- No harassment of any kind is tolerated.

- Don't make offensive or derogatory comments related to physical appearance, body size, age, race, language, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, religion or lack thereof, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, mental health, or similar identifying traits.

- Don't send excessive direct messages to or harass people who don't respond to you.

### Be inclusive

- Don't question or challenge the way that someone self-identifies or self-expresses.

- Don't post unwelcome comments or opinions regarding a person's lifestyle.

- Don't make general statements about groups that you don't belong to.

- Be mindful of the many voices in UX/UI Open's Slack community and make room for everyone who wants to engage in a conversation.

### Be relevant

- Don't post sales pitches of any kind. (All UX/UI/Product job listings and job offers can be posted in the #03-job-opportunities channel )

### Be smart

- Any information that you don't want shared outside of Slack shouldn't be posted in Slack.

- If you feel that someone posted something that violates these guidelines, email the group administrator uxui@theopenbootcamp.com

**Happy Slacking!**

## :star: 1.4 Program Overview :star:

🎯 LESSON OBJECTIVE: By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to identify the different curriculum pieces of your program, the types of assignments that you'll complete, and what is required for graduation.

🎯 This section includes an Assignment

## Overview

Your program was carefully designed to give you the **knowledg**e and **skills** that you need to get a job in your chosen field. In this checkpoint, you'll learn the major components of your program as well as what you can expect for assignments.

### Dashboard and curriculum overview

UX/UI Open programs are composed of **courses**, **modules**, and **checkpoints**. Courses are the major topics of the program, modules are the units within a course, and checkpoints are individual lessons within a module.

## Lesson types and assignments

You will be required to **complete every lesson in your program**. And each lesson will contain a **learning objective** for you to master. These learning objectives are assessed through different types of lessons, which are called checkpoints:

**1. Reading Lessons**: These checkpoints **have no assignment at the end**. Read, take notes, **absorb the information** & click Next to move on to the next checkpoint.

**2. Activity Lessons** 🎯: These checkpoints have a **small activity at the end**. You can find the lessons with activites by following this 🎯 emoji. Activites are building blocks for assignments. You might have to submit a few of these. Take your time to do them

**2. Self-Approved Assignments** ⭐: These checkpoints **include short written assignments that you will need to submit but that won't be graded**. You can find the lessons with assignments by following this ⭐ emoji. We want to keep a track of your progress throughout to give actionalbe feedback in future. Often, self-approved assignments are used as building blocks for larger assignments, so make sure to save a copy of all your work before submitting! **You will have to submit your assignments on our Slack Workspace to progress**. (We'll tell you how to submit these)

**3. Graded Assignments** 🌟: These checkpoints **include short written assignments that you will need to submit that will be graded by a member at uxuiopen**. Since we're dealing with 100's of submissions, expect a bit of slowness in our responses. **Graded assignments are mandatory to submit if you're keen on getting a certifcate at the end**. You can find the lessons with graded assignments by following this 🌟 emoji.

**4. Capstone Projects**: Your capstone projects will be the most valuable thing that you leave your program with. **Your portfolio of capstone projects will be what you show to employers to demonstrate that you are ready to work**.

Capstones can be hefty projects. A typical capstone can take about one to two weeks to complete. You will also want to plan for revision time. And don't worry if you don't pass on your first attempt; that's common. You're going to find that your capstones have a lot of moving parts. This is reflective of the work that you will deliver in the workplace. It is very rare that you will submit a major project without getting revisions from your manager or project lead.

Depending on your program, some capstones allow you some leeway in choosing a topic. When choosing a topic for these capstones, it can help to pick something that aligns with one of your hobbies or interests. It's important to have fun with this! You will put more heart into your work if you are enjoying yourself. This can also be an opportunity to show employers your personality.

If you are aiming to get into a very particular industry, it may be helpful to have at least one of your capstones built around that subject.

## Careers course

In addition to the core content, you will also complete Careers modules after your UX/UI program. We've partnered with Root Learn to access their free courses that would benefit UX/UI Open's students. The Careers course can be found at **Root Learn Careers Course**. Make sure you remember to do this at the end of your bootcamp when you're ready to apply for a job.



## Here's what you can expect to learn from the careers curriculum:

- **Brand yourself as a developer**. You will learn to act like and think about yourself as a developer—not as someone who dreams of being one or identifies as an aspiring developer.

- **Network like a pro**. You will master the art of networking in all its forms—even if you're an introvert! You will learn how to present yourself, talk about your experience, and leverage your connections.

- **Make your materials job-search ready**. You will receive guidance and feedback in creating the most effective job search materials, including resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and more.

- **Practice interviews**. You will receive guidance in the latest interview techniques and behavioral interviews.

- **Navigate a job offer**. You will receive coaching on how to evaluate and negotiate job offers.


## Graduation

There are a few components to graduating from your UX/UI Open program. **All content must be completed in order to graduate**. This includes **checkpoints** and their **assignments** (no matter the grading type), **projects**, **capstones** and **Careers module from Root Learn's Careers Course** to receive a accredited certificate from us.

Make sure to follow your syllabus and weekly schedule well in advance. Knowing what capstones and other projects are coming up and planning your time accordingly will be vital to your success in your program. It will take hard work, but if you plan and stay on track, you will be successful! You will be given an accredited certificate by us through Accredible like all major universities upon completion.

# Assignment 1 ⭐

Are you ready to get started on your new career journey? Start by submitting your first assignment. This assignment will also show you the process for submitting your coursework. Submission details for this assignment are at the bottom. In the slack workspace, answer the following questions:

- Why are you taking this program?

- How do you see your life changing by learning your program-specific skills?

- How would you describe your ideal career?

This will be an intense (and rewarding) program, and there may be times when you lose your motivation. In times like those, it is important to remember your "why." Reminding yourself why you are doing this will help you move forward and persevere.
